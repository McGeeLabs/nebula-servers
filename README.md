# nebula-servers

Nebula Servers is a self-hosted dashboard that brings your game servers into one clean view: online/offline status, live player counts, join/copy links, tagging and filtering, and notification alerts — all skinned to your existing McGee Labs theme.

## Setup

Copy the example config and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp frontend/example.servers.config.json frontend/servers.config.json
